Email marketing is an enormous part of your overall digital marketing success. However, “how to avoid spam filters” is a question that can often thwart your efforts. The fact is, over 20 percent of email marketing messages never make it to their destination (a recipient’s inbox). The major reason for this is spam filters, which score emails and reject ones with too high a risk score.

Ultimately spam filters exist to save consumers from endless streams of unwanted, fake mail. As marketers, we often have a love-hate relationship with the parameters but learning how to avoid spam filters will help us get our message to the right people.

Here are some things that may rack up a high score:

   1.Emails with JavaScript, Flash, and videos. Similarly, keep images to a minimum, and make sure they’re small. Finally, it’s best not to include forms or attachments.
   2.Sending emails when you don’t have permission; especially where anti-spam laws are strict.
   3.Emails containing “bad words” like free, promo, buy, prize, bonus, guarantee
   4.Deceptive subject lines with misleading claims (like telling somebody they’ve won a prize when they haven’t).
         A poor sender’s reputation. One major factor that can affect your reputation is a hard bounce, which happens when you send an email to a defunct or non-existent address. Therefore, to keep up your reputation, remove addresses from your list if sent emails have bounced in the past.
         Unprofessional content, i.e. auto-correct mistakes.
   5.Impersonal emails with no familiar name in the send field or personal name addressing the recipient.

#Best Practices:

Good practice includes testing your emails before sending them will help to ensure that your important marketing messages are getting through properly, and also sending emails to clean purchased contact lists without fear that emails won’t get through.


#Goal : Build a model for identifying if a question on Quora is spam 

#Suggested Guidelines : 

1. To bring down dimensions of your model you can use glove embedding shared with you ( in the data )

2. Here is how you can use pertained embeddings : https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html
